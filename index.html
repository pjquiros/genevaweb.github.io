                                            That is a book that is very inviting to read and appreciate, from one of the most preeminent and accomplished American scientist / engineer, Professor Sheldon Weinbaum. The book is highly entertaining and educational both for the young and the young at heart. Professor Weinbaum creatively and thoughtfully makes accessible some of the fundamental principles of physics and engineering to students of all ages and background. He provides vivid perspective that only someone of his stature could, helping us understand how things around us work, how they impact us, helping us appreciate them more and making us wonder why we have not known all these things all these years.
                                            
                                            Thank you Professor Weinbaum for giving us this wonderful book. Harvy is a book I want and need to read to my children and grandchildren. I am confident the amazing stories will leave them entertained, more educated and wanting more, all at the same time. My hope is that this book gets discovered broadly and is also made into a TV series that the whole family could watch and really be entertained and educated, all at the same time. I have looked for entertaining and educational books and shows that the whole family can read and watch for many years. I have not seen anything like the Harvy story out there, from character, content, delivery and relevance points of view." </p><strong>- Dr. Gabe Tzeghai, Elected Member - National Academy of Engineering</strong>

In the person of Papa/Guya or PG, a devoted grandfather, Professor Sheldon Weinbaum tells of his adventures with Harvy, a most inquisitive and clever cane, whose constant questions and observations prompt amazing scientific explanations for all sorts of common natural phenomena. Based on close observation, PG explains why planes seem to shrink as they fly away from us, how an escalator works, what a spirometer is and what it measures, how helicopters fly when they have no wings to flap, and what makes a toboggan glide on the surface of the snow. When Harvy finds he cannot float, we learn about flotation, buoyancy and density. Other adventures bring us to an understanding of various types of waves and rays, especially x-rays. The story culminates in a leap into the future describing a high-speed train that would run on the principle of jet skis on a snow surface.

                                            The stories of Harvy’s adventures with his mentor lead smoothly from one to another, and the language and scientific explanations, including clear and simple illustrations and charts, are quite easily accessible to intelligent and inquisitive children from about the age of six to eleven. Complex scientific concepts are fairly clearly explained, but it is the playful passion for scientific inquiry, the refusal to take natural phenomena for granted, and the sense of joyful discovery that are at the very heart of this work and at their best may inspire future generations of scientists." </p><strong>- Eva Richter, English Professor ; The Joy of Scientific Inquiry</strong>

                                        <p>"Professor Weinbaum, an eminent biomedical engineer, has succeeded in forging a revolution in children's literature, in his depiction of an active older scientist teacher whose able companion is his cane. 

                                            Grandfathers are usually depicted as wise, gentle, somewhat frail men who reminisce of long ago life. Here is an older man who continues to live a vigorous life of scientific inquiry, traveling and working with younger scientists and experimentalists.
                                            
                                            Children are often wary of canes and other medical aids, such as walkers and rollators. Weinbaum counters their wariness with a cherry-wood character who asks questions children appreciate. The illustrator wisely gives Harvy only expressive eyes as he is as 'adult' as the author.
                                            
                                            Most important, Harvy has a bit of moxie in his persona, encouraging the author when life seems a bit overwhelming. Able Harvy steers Weinbaum to the front of taxi lines and negotiating hotel discounts. The author learns from his cane that being unhesitant to live a challenging life, will encounter respect and help, not pity.

                                    <p>" A fun book for curious minds...

                                        This book tells the story of Harvy, a brilliant childlike cane, who travels with PG, a scientist. There are 10 short chapters that describe various adventures that Harvy and PG experience. These adventures range from exploring how an escalator works to inventing a high-speed train that is inspired by skiing. All of these stories are based on real experiences of the author, who is a grandfather and internationally well-known engineering professor.
                                        
                                        The book is best suitable for middle and high school kids who are curious about the world and eager to explore. For younger kids, parents may be needed to explain certain concepts and instill the idea that it can be fun and exciting to figure out how things work. College students and adults may also find the book interesting as the book shows how scientific discoveries are made and how scientists solve puzzles and mysteries in Nature. The author even added some paragraphs and an Appendix for readers who want to learn more details in the scientific discussion.
                                        
                                        It's a great delight to see the publication of such a fun book for satisfying the curiosity and imagination in the young minds. The book will stimulate kids’ interests in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics." </p>

This book shows what inquisitive minds can do, especially for kids who are interested in science and engineering. The best aspect of the book is the story teller, who is one of the greatest minds in the world, sharing his mystery solving skills with future generations." </p>
